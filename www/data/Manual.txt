<name> Elemental Stats
<text>

<end entry>

# Capability

<name> Capabilities
<text>
Your character's \c[17]Capability\c[0] stat towards each enemy class determines their
  proficiency against each class (View \c[14]Enemy Classes\c[0] in the Help File).

The \c[17]higher your Capability vs a certain enemy class\c[0], the \c[17]more damage you
deal to that enemy class\c[0] and the \c[17]less damage you take from that enemy class\c[0].

Against an enemy of multiple classes, your character's capability towards each
  class stacks \c[17]multiplicatively\c[0].

Bonus damage from capability can stack indefinitely. However, damage
  reduction from capability is capped at \c[17]50% Damage Reduction\c[0].

Your character's capability towards each enemy class can be viewed in the
\c[17]Status\c[0] screen of the Main Menu.

# Skills

<subentries> Skill Types I; Skill Types II; Cooldowns; Instant Cast
<text>
Here, you'll find information about all \c[17]Skill Related\c[0] aspects of the game.
<end entry>


# Skill Types

<name> Skill Types I
<text>
There are \c[17]3 Basic Skill Types\c[0] in the game: \c[14]Combat\c[0], \c[14]Special\c[0] and \c[14]Magic\c[0].
Each character has access to \c[17]2 of the 3\c[0] Skill Types.

\c[17]Combat Skills\c[0] primarily deal \c[14]Physical Damage\c[0].
The damage dealt is dependent on the user's \c[14]\i[570]Attack\c[0] stat and the target's
  \c[14]\i[571]Defense\c[0] stat.

\c[17]Magic Skills\c[0] primarily deal \c[30]Magic Damage\c[0].
The damage dealt is dependent on the user's \c[30]\i[572]Magic Attack\c[0] stat and the
  target's \c[30]\i[573]Magic Defense\c[0] stat.

\c[17]Special Skills\c[0] may deal either \c[14]Physical Damage\c[0] or \c[30]Magic Damage\c[0].
The damage dealt is dependent on the user's \c[14]\i[570]Attack\c[0] and \c[30]\i[572]Magic
Attack\c[0] stat and the target's \c[14]\i[571]Defense\c[0] and \c[30]\i[573]Magic Defense\c[0] stat.
<end entry>

<name> Skill Types II
<text>
Additionally, there are two more skill types available to all characters:
  \c[14]Break Skills\c[0] and \c[14]Passive Skills\c[0].

\c[14]Break Skills\c[0] are extremely powerful skills that require the \c[17]\i[630]Party Limit
  Gauge\c[0] to use.
Although powerful, they may take up a huge portion of the gauge, so use them
  wisely!

\c[14]Passive Skills\c[0] are skills that are not directly used in battle. Instead, they
  provide passive benefits to the character.
Passive Skills are obtained by mastering equipment passives. A list of your
  character's learned passives can be viewed in their \c[14]Skills\c[0] Tab.
<end entry>

# Cooldowns

<name> Cooldowns
<picture> cooldown; left; true
<text>
Almost all skills have a \c[17]\i[540]Cooldown\c[0] assosciated with them.





When a skill is used, it goes on its designated cooldown. While on cooldown,
the skill cannot be used until its cooldown is over.

Stronger skills usually have longer cooldowns.

Cooldowns may be altered by skills and equipment.
<end entry>

# Instant Cast

<name> Instant Cast
<text>
Some skills do not cost the character their turn to execute.

These skills are called \c[14]Instant Cast Skills\c[0] and they have a \i[446] icon over
  them.

You may use as many \c[17]Instant Cast Skills\c[0] on your turn as necessary, though
  they do have cooldowns, and overusing them could very quickly drain your
  \c[1]MP\c[0].

Certain status effects can cancel an Instant Cast Skills' Instant Use
  Properties, making them cost a turn like usual skills.
<end entry>





# Equipment

<name> Equipments
<title> Equipment
<subentries> Equipment; Equipment Types
<text>
Here, you'll find information about all \c[17]Equipment Related\c[0] aspects of the game.
<end entry>

# Equipment Basics

<name> Equipment
<picture> equipscreen; left; true
<text>
Equipments are extremely important in order to gain an edge in battle.
                                  Not only do they provide useful stats, but
                                    each equipment also has a \c[17]Passive\c[0] as well.
                                  Sometimes, an equipment's passive may outweigh a
                                    deficiency in stats in certain situations, so
                                      customize accordingly!


\py[250]Not all Equipment are created equal, even if they are the same item.
Equipments of the same name, barring those obtained from shops, can have
  varying stats, making some variances of the same equipment better than
  others. Equipment passives, however, do not vary.
So if you find equipment from loot, be sure to check for greater stat boosts!
<end entry>

# Equipment Types

<name> Equipment Types
<picture> equiptypes; left; true
<text>
Each character has \c[17]5 Equip Slots\c[0]:






\c[14]Weapons\c[0] are unique to each character. They primarily provide offensive
  bonuses.
\c[14]Accessories\c[0] are unique to each character. They primarily provide bonuses
  tailored towards the strengths of the character.
\c[14]Armor\c[0] are divided into \c[17]Male\c[0] and \c[17]Female\c[0] armor. They primarily provide
  defensive bonuses.
All \c[14]Rings\c[0] are available to all characters. They provide unique benefits.
\c[14]Boots\c[0] are divided into \c[17]General Boots\c[0] (available for all characters) and
  \c[17]Male\c[0] and \c[17]Female\c[0] boots. They provide miscellaneous bonuses.
<end entry>

# Party Limit Gauge

<name> Party Limit Gauge
#<icon> 630
<picture> limitgauge; left; true
<text>
The \c[14]Party Limit Gauge\c[0] is the gauge on the bottom right corner of the battle
  screen.




The gauge is shared with all members of the party, and it increases whenever
  the party \c[17]takes or deals\c[0] damage.
The whole gauge is divided into parts. The number above the gauge indicates
  the number of Limit Gauges your party has filled.
The gauge is carried over through battles, so you can use random encounters
  to build it up.
The Limit Gauge is used for various purposes, primarily being the cost of
  \c[18]Break Skills\c[0].
Changing Equipment and Party Members mid-battle also cost a portion of the
  Limit Gauge.
<end entry>

# Elements

<name> Elements
<text>
There are \c[17]8\c[0] different elements existing in the world.
The elements are as follows:

\py[119]\i[384]\c[18]Fire\c[0]     \px[150]\i[388]\c[20]Earth\c[0]    \px[300]\i[386]\c[17]Lightning\c[0]  \px[450]\c[27]\i[390]Holy
\py[155]\i[387]\c[1]Water\c[0]     \px[150]\i[389]\c[3]Wind      \px[300]\i[385]\c[4]Ice     \px[450]\i[391]\c[30]Dark\c[0]

\py[191]Enemies may be resistant or weak to certain elements.
You can use \c[17]\is[4]\c[0] to identify and exploit these elemental weaknesses.

Skills of a certain element have the element's icon next to them, so you can
  easily identify the element of the skill.

Each character has a certain \c[14]Proficiency\c[0] and \c[14]Rate\c[0] towards each element.
  (View \c[14]Stats > Elemental Stats\c[0] for more information).

All of your character's affinity towards each element can be viewed in their
  \c[14]Status Screen\c[0].

\c[17]States\c[0] are special properties applied to battlers that affect the way they
  function.

States may have positive or negative impacts on battlers.
Some states may affect individual battlers, while some may affect the whole
  battlefield.

Most states are unique to certain skills or enemies.

States are crucial to taking advantage of the battle, and should be used
  effectively.
